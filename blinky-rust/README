First step is to get the Rust source code from github
and check out the version with commit-hash equal to the
"nightly" compiler which we are using.

Run the "getrustsrc" script to do this.

Now, build the "core" library by running "buildcore".

Finally, build the blinking LED application by compiling
"blinky.rs" and linking it with a few other object files.

You can do this by running "build".
